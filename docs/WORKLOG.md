## 2026-05-29 · Phase 2 — APPROVED

**Done**
- Locked §8 answers in `DECISIONS.md` #25–30.
- Recommended and locked the **split hero** (value+search left; contained poster-first media
  with optional safe video + "Top this month" proof card right) over a full-bleed autoplay
  video — better for speed, conversion, trust-by-proof, and accessibility. Added wireframe
  `brand/wireframes/wf-home-hero-recommended.svg`.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` status to "Phase 2 APPROVED".

**Open / awaiting user**
- Go-ahead to start **Phase 3 — Visual Design & Design System**.

## 2026-05-29 · Phase 2 — Wireframes / UX (drafted)

**Done**
- Authored `docs/phases/PHASE-2-wireframes-ux.md` (+ branded `.docx`): global layout system,
  low-fi stacked wireframes for all 12 page groups, reusable component inventory, key
  interactions, UX states, baseline accessibility.
- Produced 5 grey-box visual wireframes in `brand/wireframes/`: home, consultores,
  consultant-profile, property-detail, agent-performance.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` status to Phase 2 (awaiting sign-off).

**Open / awaiting user**
- Answer §8 questions (hero layout, leaderboard presentation, card density, contact pattern,
  dashboard nav) — each has a recommendation.
- Go-ahead to start **Phase 3 — Visual Design & Design System**.

**Note**
- Wireframes are deliberately unstyled. Claude Code does not build from them yet; they feed
  Phase 3 visual design first.

## 2026-05-29 · Phase 1 — IA & Content (drafted)

**Done**

**Open / awaiting user**
- Answer the six §10 questions (score display, seller lead routing, seed listings, locale

## 2026-05-28 · Phase 0 — Discovery & Strategy (kickoff)

**Done**
- Created fresh project skeleton (`docs/`, `docs/phases/`, `brand/logos/`).

  + branded Word version.
- Produced 4 logo concepts + comparison sheet in `brand/logos/`.
- Defined listings-sequencing strategy (schema-first, additive, feature-flagged) so
  property listings ship inside the MVP without breaking earlier work.

**Open / awaiting user**

- On approval: scaffold the Next.js project on the remote host, init git + GitHub, then
  begin Phase 1 (sitemap, page purposes, content model, user flows).
